			<p>(Wikipedia) Flamingos or flamingoes[2] /fləˈmɪŋɡoʊz/ are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, 
				which is the only bird family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. 
				There are four flamingo species distributed throughout the Americas (including the Caribbean),
				 and two species native to Africa, Asia, and Europe.
				 (My own two cents) The flamingos in the above picture may have been posing for Valentine's day.</p>
